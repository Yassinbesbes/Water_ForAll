3. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt:**
    
    Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

4. **Navigate to a Directory:**
    
    Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. For example:
    
    ```bash
    cd path/to/directory
    ```

5. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    Use the `git clone` command followed by the URL you copied earlier to clone the repository. For example:
    
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>

8. **Run the Project:**
    
    - Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.
    - Alternatively, you can use a local server to host the files (e.g. `http-server`).
